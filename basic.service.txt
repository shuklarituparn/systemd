# Systemd files are case-sensitive, so [UNIT] is different from [Unit]

[Unit]

Description= This is used to describe the basic functionality
Requires=  This directive lists all the unit files on which this current unit file depends

If any of the unit files in the required failed to start, this unit file wont start either


Wants= Basically the same as the required but less restrictive. It would want the dependent unit files to be start parallely
but would continue working even if they don't start

BindsTo=  This also same as require but the current unit will also stop if the associated one stops

Before= The units decribed here wont start until the current unit starts

After= The unit listed in the directive will be started before starting the current unit


Conflicts= This is used to list all the unit files that can create conflicts if started at the same time. Starting a
unit with this relationship will make the other unit stop

Condition...= this used to provide a condition, if the condition is not met then the unit skips and is not executed

Assert...= basically same as condition but a negative result causes the failure of the unit to start
